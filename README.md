# rust-nbe-for-mltt

Danny Gratzer's implementation of [Normalization by Evaluation for Martin-Löf
Type Theory][nbe-for-mltt], ported to Rust.

In traditional type checking and normalization that uses [DeBruijn indices][de-bruijn-indices],
you are required to shift variable indices whenever you open up binders. This
is extremely expensive, and rules out future optimizations, like [using
visitors][visitors] to reduce the number of intermediate allocations as the AST
is traversed. This implementation avoids these problems by using a "semantic
type checking"  algorithm that uses DeBruijn indices for the raw and normal
syntax, and DeBruijn levels in the syntax of the semantic domain.

| Syntax        | Binding method              | Example                         |
|---------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Concrete      | Nominal                     | `λz. (λy. y (λx. x)) (λx. z x)` |
| Raw, Normal   | Nameless (DeBruijn Indices) | `λ . (λ . 0 (λ . 0)) (λ . 1 0)` |
| Domain        | Nameless (DeBruijn Levels)  | `λ . (λ . 1 (λ . 2)) (λ . 0 1)` |
